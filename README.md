## Day 22 and 23 Homework - Part 1
### Sweepstakes

Trade Show Booths are a common marketing tool for many companies. To help attract conference attendees to the booth, companies will often have giveaways and drawings at their booth. You've been hired to create an iPad app that allows attendees to enter their information, _and_ allows companies to pick a winner.

However, since the client didn't plan ahead (why don't they ever think ahead), this project is too big for one person to complete on time. So, you've decided to bring in a colleague to help. One of you will complete the attendee portion of the app, and the other will complete the administrative portion.

MINIMUM requirements for the Attendee part of this app:
* Using Parse as your backend database, the attendee should be able to enter their name, city and state (all of which are required) as is _one_ of email or phone number all of which need to be validated and saved to the server

MINIMUM requirements for the Administrative part of this app:
* Using the _same_ Parse database, the administrator should be able to see all of the entries displayed in a list. The list can be sorted by last name, state/city, or date entered. A winner will need to be selected from the list at random and marked in the database. Winners will be highlighted in the list. In addition, entries can be narrowed down by date range and winners (no wins, only winners, all records).

HARD MODE requirements:
* Merge the Attendee & Administrative apps into a single app. Hint: Git processes will help

## Day 22 and 23 Homework - Part 2
### Weekly News

A significant part of being a developer is keeping up with technology, especially in mobile, and particularly in iOS. We get significant changes at least 2x a year (one for hardware and one for software), and sometimes even more often. It's difficult, if not impossible, to keep up. One way to try to keep up is to keep tabs on the weekly news. So, every week you will have an assignment to find an article and share it with the class.

MINIMUM requirements for this assignment:
* Find a _unique_, _recent_ news article and share it to the iOS class on Slack
* UNIQUE: You must be the first to share that topic on Slack. A similar article on the same topic does not count.
* RECENT: It must be from the last 7 days, ideally within the last few days
* I am the ultimate arbiter of unique & recent
* Be prepared to discuss your (and everyone else's article) in the next lecture

## Day 22 and 23 Homework - Part 3
### Blog Post

Learning is not just about participating in a lecture & doing your homework. Learning takes reflection. So, every week part of your homework will be to write a blog post. The topic of each post is up to you. It can be a reflection on how you are feeling in class at that moment. It can be an instruction guide for others on how to do something we covered in class. It can be a summary of the things we've covered in class. It can be your opinions about recent news in mobile. It should be something that is either directly or tangentially related to the class.

MINIMUM requirements for this assignment:
* If you don’t have a blog, start one. If you have one, use that. Suggested Blog Sites: Medium, WordPress, Tumblr, Blogger, etc.
* Write what ever you want. Suggested Topics: how you're feeling about class, a summary of topics for the week, creating a tutorial for a particular topic, a summary of weekly mobile news, etc.
* When you’re done, post it and send me a link. If you want to keep it private, that’s fine just show me that it's posted.
